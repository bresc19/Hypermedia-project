In this section are attached the values sampled during the the execution of the user testing. In particular, 5 user was choosen for this user testing.

\subsection{Hardware and Software settings}
The study was executed using the Matteo's laptop individually by each user. There are no other type of hardaware components used to make this test.
In stead, for the software side we adopt \textit{Quick Time Player} to record the screen during the test execution. In this way, variable such as the time execution, errors and effectivenss are detected in a second moment by replaying the recording. So, users will be MORE SCIALLI. On the other hand, the evaluation of the other variables is done directly after the execution of each task.
