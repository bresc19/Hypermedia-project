This section aims to join every results obtained in the last chapter in order to give a unique score for each heuristic section. This is done by computing the arithmetic average of the scores of \textit{Navigation}, \textit{Contents} and \textit{Layout} sections.\par

\section{Scores}
\subsection{MiLE}
\textbf{Navigation}\par
The navigation score is given by the mean of the 5 aspects analyzed in the section \ref{Navigation}. \par 
The final result is: 
(4.5 + 4.5 + 4 + 3.5 + 3.5)/5 = \textbf{4}\par
Therefore, content aspect in the Moviri website is handled well, even if could be improved again.

\par\medskip

\textbf{Contents}\par
The score of this section is given simply by the score evaluated by the \textit{Information Overload} heuristic which is \textbf{4.5}. \par
So basing only this heuristic, content of the website is almost fully satisfied. Improvements could be done, but fixes will be minimal.

\par\medskip

\textbf{Layout}\par
The layout score is given by the mean of 5 aspects analyzed in the section \ref{Layout}. \par
The final result is: 
(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3)/5 = 3.8 \\
\textit{which can be approximated to} \textbf{4}\par
Basing on the result, layout of the website it's pretty well designed, but with some critical issues that should be fixed in order to have the best experience.

\subsection{Nielsen}
Instead, the evaluation with this set of heuristics is made by making the average of all the six heuristcs analyzed:
(2 + 4 + 3.5 + 4 + 5 + 4.5)/6 = 3.8 \\
\textit{which can be approximated to} \textbf{4}.\par

\section{Comments}
As evidenced by the results obtained from the analysis carried out by our team, the site has high standards obtained on the various fields evaluated and, although there are criticalities widely described in the appropriate sections, as a whole it is functional, well done and adequate for its purpose of use; our work concerning the Inspection of the web site therefore ends with an overall satisfactory score.
